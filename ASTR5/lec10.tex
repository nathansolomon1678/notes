\subsection{Evolution on Earth}
\fig{hominids.png}
For a long time, evolution of life on Earth was very slow. Single celled life dominated from 3.5 Gya to 1.2 Gya, and animals evolved in the ocean only from 1.2 Gya to 0.6 Gya. Biomarker fossils of sponges appeared 600 Mya. Finding these fossils was extremely likely, because usually for fossils to form, we need bones, hard shells, or at least plant fiber.
\par
The concept of evolution has been around for a while. The natural philosopher Anaximander (610-547 BC) proposed that life began in water, and used to be much simpler. In the early 1800s, Jean-Baptiste Lamarck claimed that life forms evolve by gradually adapting to their environments. Then in 1859, Charles Darwin published \textit{The Origin of Species}, which contained a bunch of evidence for the theory of evolution.
\par
\textit{Speciation} is the process by which organisms gain unique adaptation to be better suited for their environments, thus forming new species. The concept of a species (a group of organisms which can produce fertile offspring together) is kind of messy -- we want it to be an equivalene relation, but it's not transitive. Also, it doesn't work at all for organisms which reproduce asexually.
\par
Finches on the Galapagos islands all share a common ancestor, but they evolved into many species: some have hard beaks to eat seeds, some evolved to eat bugs out of tree bark, etc.
\par
Natural selection is not the only cause of evolution. Human selection (aka artificial selection) has turned wild mustard (\textit{Brassica oleracea}) into a whole bunch of different, tasty vegetables.

Eyes have evolved by convergent evolution. Only 6 of the 36 animal phyla have evolved eyes of any sort.

\subsection{Extremophiles}
\fig{grand_prismatic_spring.jpg}
Thermophiles live in very hot water (sometimes over 100 Celsius), such as Yellowstone's hot springs.
\par
Psychrophiles live in extreme cold, even in Antarctica.
\par
Endoliths live in porous rocks several kilometers below the Earth's surface.
\par
Although most extremophiles are archaebacteria, tardigrades are a notable example of a multicelled animal, about 1 mm in length. They do this using cryptobiosis, where they lose 99\% of their water but remain alive. Because they are so tough, they have endured through all 5 mass extinctions in the last 500 million years.
\par
Early life on Earth likely resembled these extremophiles, especially the one living in deep sea vents and relying on chemosynthesis.
\par
The extreme adaptations of organisms on Earth imply that if life exists anywhere on another world, it probably exists all over that world.
