\section{4/4/2024 lecture}

To pass this class, you need to attempt every homwork (if there is homework), go to the midterm and the final, and have at least 60\% attendance.
\par
Most of the exam content is based on lectures. There will be practice exams.

Fun fact: professor Rich was a PhD advisor to Neil Tyson.

Saturn's moon Enceladus has plumes of salt water, and under the surface, it contains phosphorus, which is essential to life.
\par
A planet is defined as a moderately large object which orbits a star and shine only by relfecting light from that star. A moon is any object which orbits a planet.
\par
An astronomical unit is the average distance from Earth to the sun, but was redefined in 2012 to be $1.5 \times 10^{11} \text{ m}$, or roughly 93 million miles. A light-year is 63000 astronomical units. A parsec (which is a portmanteau of ``parallax" and ``arccsecond") is 206000 AU, or 3.26 light-years.
\par
Our galaxy is disk-shaped, roughly a thousand light-years thick and 100 thousand light years in diameter. We are 28 thousand light years from the center, and take about 230 million years to make a full orbit. Our solar system orbits the galaxy at a speed of around 540,000 mph.
\par
The Earth has mass $5.97 \times 10^{24} kg$ and radius 4000 miles (6400 kilometers). The equator rotates at a speed of $2 \pi (4000 \text{ miles}) / (1 \text{ day}) = 1000 \text{ mph} = 1650 \text{ km/h}$.
\par
The distance from the Earth to the sun is 147.1 million km at the closest point (perihelion) and 152.1 million km at the farthest point (aphelion). The average distance is called an astronomical unit, or AU (1 AU is about 150 million km). The eccentricity of the Earth's orbit is 0.017, which is negligible, and the typical speed of the Earth around the sun is $2 \pi (150 \text{ million km}) / (1 \text{ year}) = 108000 \text{ km/h}$.
\par
The cosmic calendar is a tool for undertanding the timeline of our universe. If that timeline were scaled down from 13.8 billion years to a single year, such that the big bang was January first. In this calendar, the MIlky Way forms in March, the Sun and planets form in August, the oldest know life appears in Spetember, and the first Multicellular life arises in November. Dinosaurs aren't wiped out until December 29th, and written language is invented 15 seconds before midnight.

The current mass composition of the universe is predicted to be as follows:

In astrophysics, we often use the following symbols as subsripts -- for example, $R_\oplus$ is the radius of the Earth.
