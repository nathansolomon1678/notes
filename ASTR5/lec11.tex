\subsection{Martian blueberries}
There are mysterious rocks on the surface of Mars, called blueberries, which are very round pieces of hematite. One theory for how they formed is that groundwater flowed through porous rocks a long time ago, eroding them into sphere which remain in the now rocky plains.
\subsection{Stromatolites}
Stromatolites are sedimentary rock formations that were made by cyanobacteria (and other bacteria). Some bacteria were able to create organic adhesives, which stuck together, sank to the bottom of the oceans, and fossilized in layers.
\subsection{Orbital resonance}
Orbital resonance prevents orbits from becoming circular, and tidal heating only affects eccentric orbits.
