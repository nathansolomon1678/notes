\section{5/9/2024 lecture}
\begin{itemize}
    \item How do we know that Venus has a 100 times higher deuterium to hydrogen ratio than Earth? How is this evidence for water? (note that deuterium half life is around 12 years)
    \item Magnetic field measurements suggest that Callisto is a conductor, but why do we think that's from a subsurface (liquid saltwater) ocean? couldn't that instead be because of some sort of metal, instead of from fluid water?
    \item Radio interferometry
    \item Stromatolites
    \item How does tidal heating work, and why does orbital resonance prevent it?
    \item Are Ganymede and Io the only other bodies in the solar system that we think might have geological activity?
    \item What are the proposed origins of Martian blueberries?
    \item Methanogenesis on Enceladus
    \item White dwarf vs neutron star vs quark star vs quasar vs magnetar vs brown dwarf
    \item Venus could have been habitable for 1-3 billion years before the sun became brighter. Mars would have been in the habitable zone if it were more massive, because then it could have internal heat, a magnetic field, and an atmosphere
    \item Exoplanets
    \item Read the textbook for this class
    \item Finish reading Kyle Chui's notes (left off at lecture 13)
\end{itemize}
