Lost of the simplest organisms on Earth live near deep sea vents, including ``smokers", which have never been found anywhere except around those vents. One of the most common organisms on Earth is cyanobacteria, which are responsible for putting diatomic oxygen gas in our atmosphere.
\par
If life is found on other planets, we hypothesize that they are single-celled, like bacteria. Looking for extremophiles on Earth helps us understand which extreme environments on other planets could support life.
\par
There is no research to actually look for extraterrestrial life, but there is research on exoplanets. Unfortunately, exoplanets are very hard to observe. The main way to observe them is using the ``transit method", which means seeing how much a star appears to dim periodically due to a planet orbiting it.
\par
There are roughly 100 billion stars in our galaxy, and about the same number of ``terrestrial planets" (although most terrestrial planets can't support life).
\par
In a span of only 50 years, we have sent spacecrafts to every planet in the solar system. We have also visited major moons and other bodies, the farthest of which is the Kuiper Belt object Arrakoth, 45 AU away. We have photographed volcanos on Jupiter's moon Io, as well as plumes of salt water from Saturn's moon Enceladus. Here's a picture of a volcano on Io:

A star is a huge ball of mostly hydrogen plasma which generates heat and light by nuclear fusion. Our star, the sun, has about 333000 times as much mass as the Earth. Larger stars have shorter lifespans. The sun is about halfway through its 10 million year lifespan.
\par
A planet is a moderately large object which orbits a star, and shines mainly by reflecting light. Most planets are classified as either ``rocky", ``icy", or ``gaseous". Pluto and other objects farther from the sun than Neptune are now called ``dwarf planets".
\par
A satellite is an object which orbits a much more massive object. A natural satellite which orbits a planet is called a moon.
\par
An asteroid is a relatively small and rocky object which orbits a star. Since asteroids are small, they are typically not spherical. A comet is a relatively small and icy object which orbits a star.
\par
A nebula is a huge interstellar cloud of gas/plasma and dust (mainly hydrogen).
\par
A galaxy is a cluster of stars held together by gravity, all orbiting a common center. We don't understand galaxies very well -- the outer parts seem to orbit the center much faster than we'd expect based on the amount of mass we observe closer to the center of the galaxy, which has led us to look for ``dark matter" which interacts with ordinary matter mostly via gravity.
