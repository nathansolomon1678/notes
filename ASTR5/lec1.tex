\subsection{Extremophiles}
Lost of the simplest organisms on Earth live near deep sea vents, including ``smokers", which have never been found anywhere except around those vents. One of the most common organisms on Earth is cyanobacteria, which are responsible for putting diatomic oxygen gas in our atmosphere.
\par
If life is found on other planets, we hypothesize that they are single-celled, like bacteria.
\par
There is no research to actually look for extraterrestrial life, but there is research on exoplanets. Unfortunately, exoplanets are very hard to observe.
