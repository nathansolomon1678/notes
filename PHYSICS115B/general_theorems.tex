\tableofcontents

\section{Eigenvalues \& eigenvectors of Hermitian matrices}
Prove eigenvalues are orthogonal, and discuss when there are repeated eigenvalues. Also, show that determinate states (of an observable) are the same as the eigenvectors (of the corresponding operator).

\section{Energy degeneracy in one dimension}
Suppose there are two wavefunctions in 1D with the same energy, then prove those wavefunctions are the same.

\section{Riesz-Fischer theorem}
Prove that the set of $L^2$ functions has a countable basis.

\section{Ehrenfest's theorem}

\section{Fourier inversion theorem}

\section{(General) uncertainty principle}

\section{Observables are conserved iff they commute with Hamiltonian}

\section{Proof that gaussian minimizes ``total uncertainty"}

\section{Virial theorem (quantum version)}

\section{Conservation of probability current}

\section{Heisenberg picture}
Show that this is equivalent to the Schr√∂dinger picture.

\section{Spin statistics theorem}
Spin is always a multiple of 1/2. Exchange relation is symmetric for bosons and antisymmetric for fermions.
