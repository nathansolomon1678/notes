That is not possible. If $v_1+v_2$, $v_2+v_3$, and $v_3+v_1$ are linearly dependent, then there exist constants $a_1, a_2, a_3$ which are not all zero, for which
\[ a_1(v_1+v_2)+a_2(v_2+v_3)+a_3(v_3+v_1)=0. \]

$V$ is isomorphic to $k^d$, for some nonnegative integer $d$, so $49=\abs{V}=\abs{k}^d$. This equation is only satisfied if $\abs{k}=7$ and $d=2$, or if $\abs{k}=49$ and $d=1$. In either case, $k$ is finite and $k^d$ is finite-dimensional (with dimension either 1 or 2), which means $V$ also has dimension 1 or 2.

    \item For any $w_1 \in W_1$, let $w_2=0$. Since every subspace contains the zero element, $w_2$ is in $W_2$, which means $w_1 + w_2 \in W_1 + W_2$. But $w_1 = w_1+0=w_1+w_2$, so every $w_1 \in W_1$ is also in $W_1+W_2$. This means $W_1 \subset W_1+W_2$, and by the same logic, $W_2$ is also a subset of $W_2+W_1$.
    \item $W_1+W_2$ is clearly a subset of $V$, since $V$ is closed under addition and scalar multiplication, so I only need to show two things: that $W_1+W_2$ is closed under addition, and that it's closed under scalar multiplication. For any $u_1+u_2, v_1+v_2 \in W_1+W_2$, we have $(u_1+u_2)+(v_1+v_2) = (u_1+v_1)+(u_2+v_2)$, which is in $W_1+W_2$ because $u_1+v_1$ is in $W_1$ and $u_2+v_2$ is in $W_2$.
        \par
        $W_1+W_2$ is closed under scalar multiplication, because for any scalar $a$ and vector $w_1+w_2 \in W_1+W_2$, $a(w_1+w_2)=aw_1+aw_2$ is in $W_1+W_2$ because $aw_1 \in W_1$ and $aw_2 \in W_2$.
