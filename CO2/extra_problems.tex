\begin{prob}
    Show that if a Steiner triple system $S(2,3,n)$ exists then $n \equiv 1$ or $n \equiv 3 \pmod{6}$.
\end{prob}

\begin{prob}
    In a group of 70 students, ofr every choice of distinct students $A,B$, students $A$ knows a language which student $B$ does not know. At least how many languages do they know together?
\end{prob}

\begin{prob}
    Use the Fano plane for making a schedule for 8 bridge players to play at 2 tables (4 at each) on 7 consecutive days so that any 3 players are together at the same table exactly once.
\end{prob}

\begin{prob}
    Modify the definition of Zykov graph $Z_{n+1}$ so that instead of $n$ coplies of $Z_n$, one copy of $Z_i$ is used for is used for $i=1,2,\dots,n$. Show that $\chi(Z_n)=n$ is still true.
\end{prob}

\begin{prob}
    Prove that the edges of the complete graph $K_\mathbb{R}$ can be 2-colored so that the largest complete monochromatic subgraph has size at most $\aleph_0$.
\end{prob}

\begin{prob}
    Show that if the edges of a countable infinite 3-uniform hypergraph are colored with red or blue in any fashion then there is a monochromatic infinite complete 3-uniform subhypergraph in it.
\end{prob}

\begin{prob}
    Prove that $R(n) \leq R_3(6,n)$.
\end{prob}
