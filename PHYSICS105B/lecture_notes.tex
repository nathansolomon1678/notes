\maketitle

The class textbook is \textit{Classical Mechanics of Particles and Systems, 5th edition} by Marion \& Thornton. These notes are a supplement for the textbook, not a replacement, so I won't cover everything from the course

\tableofcontents
\section{Review of Lagrangian mechanics}
\subsection{Calculus of variations}
Use catenary and brachiostrome as examples
\subsection{Least action principle}
\subsection{Generalized momenta}
\subsection{Lagrange multipliers, forces from constraints}

\section{Phase diagrams}
The state of many systems can be described by generalized positions ($q_1, q_2, \dots$) and generalized velocities ($\dot{q_1}, \dot{q_2}, \dots$). For example, the state of a pendulum at any time can be described by the vector
\[ \begin{bmatrix}
    \theta \\
    \dot{\theta}
\end{bmatrix}, \]
and if we know the state, we can calculate the rate of change of the state. That is,
\[ \begin{bmatrix}
    \dot{\theta} \\
    \ddot{\theta}
\end{bmatrix} \]
is a function of the state. We can visualize this as a vector field, where $x = \theta$ and $y = \dot{\theta}$. One amazing tool for drawing vector fields is

For the pendulum example, copy this code:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=C]
// p.x and p.y are current coordinates
// v.x and v.y is a velocity at point p
vec2 get_velocity(vec2 p) {
  vec2 v = vec2(0., 0.);
  v.x = p.y;
  v.y = cos(p.x);
  return v;
}
\end{lstlisting}

For a Van der Pol oscillator, copy in this code, and experiment with changing $\mu$ (mu):
\begin{lstlisting}[language=C]
float mu = 1.;
vec2 get_velocity(vec2 p) {
  vec2 v = vec2(0., 0.);
  v.x = p.y;
  v.y = mu * (1. - p.x * p.x) * p.y - p.x;
  return v;
}
\end{lstlisting}
Here is a Van der Pol oscillator with $\mu = 1$:

\section{Rotating reference frames}
Chapter 10 in the textbook. Copy example 10.5 (Foucault pendulum) to these notes

\section{Synchronized oscillators}
Include links to and screenshots of synchronizing oscillators from the ``Explorable explanations" website (although that's different from the oscillators we are talking about here).

\section{Moment of inertia tensor}
Compare the off-diagonal elements (``products of inertia") to the formula for Pearson's correlation coefficient, which measures how much stuff is on a diagonal line between the $x$ and $y$ axes. Use this to give an intuitive explanation of what diagonalizing $I$ represents.
