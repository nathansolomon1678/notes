    Prove or disprove: if $u$ and $v$ are the only vertices in a graph with odd degree, then there is a path from $u$ to $v$.
}}}\bigskip\par
Assume this question is talking about simple graph, and not multigraphs. If multigraphs are allowed, there is an obvious counterexample: the graph with two vertices which each have one edge to themselves, but are not connected to each other.
\par
Suppose there exists a (simple) graph $G$ in which $u$ and $v$ are the only vertices with odd degree, and there is no path from $u$ to $v$. Then let $U$ be the connected component of $G$ which contains $u$ but not $v$. The only vertex in $U$ with odd degree is $u$, so the sum of the degrees of each vertex in $U$ is odd. But because $U$ is a simple graph, it must follow the handshaking lemma, so this is a contradiction. Therefore there must be a path in $G$ from $u$ to $v$.

    How many Hamiltonian cycles does $K_n$ have? Two Hamiltonian cycles are considered distinct if their set of edges are different.
}}}\bigskip\par
Given a Hamiltonian cycle of $K_n$, we can write the cycle as a permutation of $[n]$ by first choosing which of the $n$ vertices to start at, then choosing which direction to go in (if $n > 2$, there are two choices of which direction to go in, otherwise there are only one). If $n$ is either 1 or 2, then there is exactly one Hamiltonian cycle in $K_n$. Otherwise, there are exactly $2n$ ways to write each Hamiltonian cycle of $K_n$ as a permutation of $[n]$.
\par
For any $\sigma \in \operatorname{Aut}([n])$, the sequence of vertices $(\sigma(1), \sigma(2), \dots, \sigma(n), \sigma(1))$ represents a Hamiltonian cycle in $K_n$. Therefore every permutation of $[n]$ corresponds to a Hamiltonian cycle of $K_n$, so if $n > 2$, there are $n!/(2n)=(n-1)!/2$ Hamiltonian cycles of $K_n$.

Every edge in this graph connects a red and a blue node. Since a Hamiltonian cycle is a subgraph, it would also have that property, so it would visit the same number of red and blue vertices. However, to be a Hamiltonian cycle, it must visit each of the 4 blue vertices and the 5 red vertices exactly once. That's a contradiction, so the graph is not Hamiltonian.
