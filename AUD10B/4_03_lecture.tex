\section{Traditions, Old \& New}
Because the printing press hadn't been invented until the 15th century, knowledge of architecture spread very slowly.
\par
One of the earliest texts we've found on architecture was \textit{De architectura}, written by Vitruvius in Rome around 30 BCE. Its rediscovery in 1540 was very exciting for people who idolized Roman architecture, but it didn't have any pictures. Because styles had evolved a over time, that meant a lot was lost in translation. The Roman style set a long-lasting precedent for how to design buildings, but people were eager to break it.
\par
The people who were seen as ``qualified" and educated enough to know which rules to break became known as architects.
\par
Meanwhile, in China, the Qing dynasty began when Manchurians invaded Beijing without destroying the city, so the Chinese architectural style became their own. One example is the Mukden Palace Complex in Shenyang, China (1625-1783). An iconic part of that style is \textbf{Dougong}, a traditional structural motif made of ornate interlocking wooden brackets, usually just below the roofs.
\par
The Manchurian people also brought their own traditions -- for example, 8 was considered an important number in their culture, so they made the Shenyang Imperial Palace to be an 8-sided building which uses the red \& gold paint (and dougong) they saw in existing Chinese buildings.

Meanwhile, the Moghul Empire (1526-1707) had its capital in Agra, and one of the most important buildings there was the Red Fort, which used red sandstone from nearby, as well as domes and arches and other decorations used in Iran. Since the Moghul Empire was ruled by conquerors from central Asia, they had to build defensive fortifications, but they also wanted to use Indian architectural styles so they don't appear as outsiders. One of the Indian motifs they used in the Red Fort was \textbf{chhatri}: the semi-open, domed pavilions seen at the top left and top right of the piture below.

That same building also used Iranian stylistic elements, such as \textbf{iwan}: an entryway enclosed on 3 sides, usually vaulted with a pointed arch. You can see an iwan at the entryway to the Red Fort in the image above. They also used these mosque-like elements for the Taj Mahal. The Taj Mahal was a real mashup of Indian and Iranian sytles -- for example, minarets are very common in mosques, and the Taj Mahal places chhatri atop the minarets.
